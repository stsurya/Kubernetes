## Deployments

A deployment provides declarative updates for pods and replica sets.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

- In Kubernetes a deployment is a method of launching a pod with containerized applications and ensuring that the necessary number of replicas is always running on the cluster.

## What is Service Mesh ?

- It's used for traffic management between the microserivces in k8s.

## Why do we need Service Mesh ?

- mTLS(Mutual TLS).
- Canary deployments.
- Observabiltiy of traffic flow between in services ith kiali.
- few other features.

## üìò 1. What is a Service Mesh?

A **Service Mesh** is an infrastructure layer that controls **service-to-service communication** within a **microservices architecture**. It provides:

- **Secure communication** between services (mTLS)
- **Traffic management** (routing, retries, circuit breaking)
- **Observability** (metrics, logs, tracing)
- **Policy enforcement**

> üß† Think of it as a "dedicated communication layer" for microservices.

---

## üß± 2. What is Istio?

**Istio** is a **popular open-source service mesh** built on top of **Envoy proxy**. It helps you secure, control, and observe services running on Kubernetes.

---

## üèóÔ∏è 3. Istio Architecture

### üîπ Components

| Component       | Function                                                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Envoy Proxy** | Sidecar proxy injected into pods; intercepts all incoming/outgoing traffic |
| **Istiod**      | Control plane that manages proxies, policies, config, and certificates     |
| **Gateway**     | Manages ingress/egress traffic (external access)                           |

### üî∏ Data Plane vs Control Plane

- **Data Plane**: Actual traffic routing via Envoy sidecars.
- **Control Plane**: Configures the data plane (routing rules, policies, mTLS).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Installing Istio in Kubernetes (Demo Profile)

```
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
cd istio-*
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH

istioctl install --set profile=demo -y

kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

‚úÖ This installs Istio and enables **automatic sidecar injection** for the default namespace.

---

## üì¶ 5. Deploying Sample App (BookInfo)

Istio provides a sample microservices app called **BookInfo**.

```
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
```

‚úÖ Each service gets an Envoy proxy (2/2 containers).

---

## üåê 6. Creating an Istio Gateway and VirtualService

### ‚úÖ Gateway

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
```

### ‚úÖ VirtualService

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: bookinfo
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - bookinfo-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        exact: /productpage
    route:
    - destination:
        host: productpage
        port:
          number: 9080
```

This routes external requests to `/productpage` to the internal `productpage` service.

---

## üö¶ 7. Traffic Management

### ‚úÖ Canary Deployment (Split Traffic)

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  host: reviews
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 80
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      weight: 20
```

üí° This sends 80% traffic to `v1`, 20% to `v2`.

---

## üîê 8. Security with Istio

### ‚úÖ Mutual TLS (mTLS)

Istio automatically:

- Issues TLS certificates to services
- Enables service-to-service **mTLS**
- Prevents unauthorized access

You can enforce mTLS with:

```
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

---

## üìà 9. Observability in Istio

Istio provides integration with tools like:

| Tool           | Purpose                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Prometheus** | Metrics collection (e.g., CPU, latency) |
| **Grafana**    | Dashboards for metrics                  |
| **Jaeger**     | Distributed tracing                     |
| **Kiali**      | Service graph visualization             |

‚úÖ All are auto-enabled with the demo profile.

---

## üß™ 10. Fault Injection & Resilience Testing

### ‚úÖ Delay Example

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: ratings
spec:
  hosts:
  - ratings
  http:
  - fault:
      delay:
        fixedDelay: 5s
        percent: 100
    route:
    - destination:
        host: ratings
```

‚úÖ This introduces a 5-second delay in **100% of requests** to the `ratings` service.

---

## üîÑ 11. Circuit Breaking

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: ratings
spec:
  host: ratings
  trafficPolicy:
    connectionPool:
      http:
        http1MaxPendingRequests: 1
        maxRequestsPerConnection: 1
    outlierDetection:
      consecutiveErrors: 1
      interval: 1s
      baseEjectionTime: 30s
```

‚úÖ This breaks the circuit (stops requests) if `ratings` fails too often.

---

## üßµ 12. Service Mesh without Sidecars (Ambient Mesh - Advanced)

Istio is also introducing **Ambient Mesh**, which removes sidecars and uses **zTunnels** and **eBPF** for traffic interception to reduce overhead.

---

## üéØ 13. Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case               | Istio Feature                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Blue/Green Deployment  | Weighted Routing                       |
| Securing Microservices | mTLS, AuthorizationPolicy              |
| Debugging Failures     | Distributed Tracing via Jaeger         |
| Rate Limiting          | EnvoyFilters or Istio RateLimitService |
| SRE Dashboards         | Prometheus + Grafana                   |

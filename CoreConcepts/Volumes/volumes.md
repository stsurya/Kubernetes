# 1. What are **Volumes** in Kubernetes?

Normally, when a pod dies, **everything inside** the container (like files) is **lost**.  
So Kubernetes gives **Volumes** â€” a way to **store data outside the container**.

âœ… Volumes **survive** even if the container restarts.  
âœ… Volumes can be **shared** between containers in the same pod.

ðŸ‘‰ **Example:**

- You have a web server saving logs.
- Without a volume: logs disappear when pod restarts.
- With a volume: logs are safe!

# 2. What is a **PersistentVolume** (PV)?

Now, Kubernetes said:  
_"Okay, letâ€™s make some **real storage** that lives **outside of pods**."_

So they invented **Persistent Volumes (PV)**.

âœ… A **PV** is **real storage** in your cluster.  
âœ… It could be backed by **Azure Disk, Azure Files, NFS**, etc.  
âœ… Itâ€™s created once and can be used by many pods over time.

**Think of PV like:**  
ðŸ“¦ A storage box that's waiting for someone to come and use it.

---

# 3. What is a **PersistentVolumeClaim** (PVC)?

Pods **canâ€™t directly use a PV**.

Instead, the pod says:  
_"Hey, I need storage with 5GiB space!"_

And that's what a **PVC** is:  
âœ… A **PVC** is a **request** for storage.  
âœ… It **claims** (hence PersistentVolumeClaim) a matching PV.

ðŸ“¢ **PVC asks**, PV **gives**.

The access modes are:<br>

**ReadWriteOnce**<br>
the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. **ReadWriteOnce** access mode still can allow multiple pods to access (read from or write to) that volume when the pods are running on the same node. For single pod access, please see **ReadWriteOncePod**.<br>
**ReadOnlyMany**<br>
the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.<br>
**ReadWriteMany**<br>
the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.<br>
**ReadWriteOncePod**<br>
the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod. Use **ReadWriteOncePod** access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across the whole cluster can read that PVC or write to it.<br>

# 4. What is a **StorageClass**?

Imagine your cluster has different **types of storage**:

- Fast SSDs
- Cheaper standard disks
- Azure Files (shared storage)

**StorageClass** tells Kubernetes:
âœ… How to **automatically create** the right type of storage  
âœ… What kind of **performance/cost** you want

ðŸ“¢ You specify a StorageClass in PVC to say:  
_"I want a fast storage"_ or _"I want a shared file system storage."_

**Without StorageClass**, you have to manually create PVs yourself.

# ðŸ“š Simple flow:

| What it is            | Role                                                       | Example                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Volume                | Temporary storage inside a pod                             | EmptyDir, HostPath, etc.           |
| PersistentVolume      | Actual storage resource created (managed by admin/cluster) | Azure Disk, Azure File             |
| PersistentVolumeClaim | Request by user/pod to use storage                         | _"Give me 1Gi of storage"_         |
| StorageClass          | Template to create PV dynamically                          | AzureDisk, AzureFile storage class |

# ðŸŽ¯ Real Life Example:

Imagine this like a **hotel**:

- **PersistentVolume**: a **room** available in hotel.
- **PVC**: you are **booking** a room.
- **StorageClass**: **room type** (deluxe, budget, sharing room).

# ðŸ§  Bonus Tip (AKS-specific):

In AKS:

- **Azure Disk** â†’ Good for single pod (ReadWriteOnce)
- **Azure File** â†’ Good for multiple pods (ReadWriteMany)

---

# ðŸ”¥ One-Liner Summary:

> Volumes are temporary. PVs are permanent storage. PVCs are the request for PVs. StorageClass decides **how** to create PVs dynamically.

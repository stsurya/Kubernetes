## ❓**How would you migrate a namespace from one AKS cluster to another using Velero?**

### ✅ **Answer (Simple & Structured):**

> To migrate a namespace from one AKS cluster to another using Velero, I follow these steps:

---

### 🔹 1. **Install Velero on both source and target clusters**

- Install the Velero CLI and server on both clusters
- Use the same cloud provider plugin and object storage backend (e.g., Azure Blob)

```bash
velero install \
  --provider azure \
  --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-microsoft-azure \
  --bucket <bucket-name> \
  --secret-file ./credentials-velero \
  --backup-location-config resourceGroup=<rg>,storageAccount=<sa-name>
```

---

### 🔹 2. **Create a backup of the namespace in the source cluster**

```bash
velero backup create my-ns-backup --include-namespaces my-namespace
```

- This backs up Kubernetes resources and volume data (if configured with restic or CSI).

---

### 🔹 3. **Switch kubeconfig context to the target cluster**

```bash
kubectl config use-context <target-cluster-context>
```

---

### 🔹 4. **Ensure Velero is installed and pointing to the same storage bucket**

- The target cluster's Velero should be configured to **access the same bucket** used by the source cluster so it can **see the backup**.

---

### 🔹 5. **Restore the backup in the target cluster**

```bash
velero restore create --from-backup my-ns-backup
```

- This will recreate all resources from the backup, including Deployments, Services, PVCs, etc.

---

### ✅ **Key Notes to Mention in Interviews:**

- Make sure to handle **storage class compatibility** if PVs are involved.
- You can optionally **remap namespaces or resources** during restore if needed.
- Velero supports **partial restores** using filters like `--include-resources` or `--label-selector`.

### 🧠 Sample Bonus Line:

> “Velero enables seamless namespace migration between clusters by combining Kubernetes object backup with optional volume data backup via CSI or Restic. Using a common backup bucket between clusters makes this migration portable and reliable.”

## Monitoring

The Metrics Server is a lightweight and essential tool for monitoring the real-time resource usage of Kubernetes clusters. It plays a critical role in enabling autoscaling and providing basic resource utilization metrics. For advanced monitoring, it is often complemented by tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

- On AKS this metrics-server is by default installed.

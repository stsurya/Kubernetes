# Deployment

A deployment provides declarative updates to Replica Sets and Pods. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at controlled rate. You can define to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all the resources with new Deployments.

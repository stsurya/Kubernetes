## What is Kubernetes ?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, scaling containerized applications. It is also know as K8s.

## Disadvanatges of Docker and Why Kubernetes ?

Docker is good for simple apps or fast development, while Kubernetes is better for large, complex projects. Docker has some disadvantages, including:

### Limited scalability:

Docker doesn't have a built-in feature for scaling, and Swarm doesn't provide the same level of scalability as Kubernetes.

### Limited automation:

Docker's automation and orchestration capabilities aren't as robust as other containerized platforms like Kubernetes.

### Limited self-healing:

Docker Swarm doesn't have built-in self-healing capabilities like Kubernetes.
Docker containers don't run at bare-metal speeds.

Kubernetes has several advantages over Docker, including:

### Scalability:

Kubernetes can scale up applications horizontally or vertically while efficiently utilizing physical resources like CPU/RAM/Storage.

### Automatic scaling:

Kubernetes provides automatic scaling and can replace faulty pods if required.

### Fault tolerant:

Kubernetes is highly available and fault tolerant.
